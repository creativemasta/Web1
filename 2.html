    <h2>what is CSS?</h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS">Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</a> is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML.<br>
CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.<br>
CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts.<br>
This separation can improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics,<br>
enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file which reduces complexity and repetition<br>
 in the structural content as well as enabling the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.</p>
